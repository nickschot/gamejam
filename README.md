# Robopocalypse
"Once a vibrant city, after the nuclear disaster five years ago, there is not much left. Protected from the radiation by shields, some people have survived. 
Today, one very old robot was found, and a way off this destroyed world lies before you. It is up to you to make use of this robot, gather the necessary resources, and find a way to save everyone."

## How to play
You can give your robot binary commands to go out into the world and find the resources you need to improve life in this horrible world. This world still provides some resources from left over waste and destroyed buildings. 
The resources you can find are: iron, plastic, stone, glass and lead. With these resources you can upgrade your robot and build more robots.

## How to code
You can code your robot by giving the robot bits, either one or zero. If you don't have enough bits to programm the full 3-bit string the robot will add zeros to your string. 

* 000 - Return to city (doable with one bit)
* 100 - Mine iron (doable with one bit)
* 010 - Mine plastic (doable with two bits)
* 110 - Mine stone (only doable with two bits)
* 001 - Mine lead (only doable with three bits)
* 011 - Mine glass (only doable with three bits)

## How to expand
You can expand your army of world-rescuring robots by unlocking the Robot Factory and then buying more robots. A robot cost 500 iron and 500 plastic.
You can unlock more features in the tech tree, such as more bits (called commands), more storage for your robots and more drive speed for your robots.

## Controls
In the tech tree and when you have enough robots you can scroll through the list by dragging.
