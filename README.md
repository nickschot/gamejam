# Robopocalypse
"Once a vibrant city, after the nuclear disaster five years ago, there is not much left. Protected from the radiation by shields, some people have survived. 
Today, one very old robot was found, and a way off this destroyed world lies before you. It is up to you to make use of this robot, gather the necessary resources, and find a way to save everyone."

## How to play
You can give your robot binary commands to go out into the world and find the resources you need to improve life in this horrible world. This world still provides some resources from left over waste and destroyed buildings. 
The resources you can find are: iron, plastic, stone, glass and lead. With these resources you can upgrade your robot and build more robots.
